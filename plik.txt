The first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, many programmers still use "ANSI C" to refer to the standard.[who?] While some software developers use the term ISO C, others are standards-body neutral and use Standard C.
